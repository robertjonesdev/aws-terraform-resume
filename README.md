# Terraform Managed, AWS Hosted Resume

![System Design](/AWS.drawio.png)

While I'm #OpenToWork, I like to stay sharp with both established and new technologies. Recently, I deployed my resume as a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, and Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This project reinforced my expertise in AWS cloud architecture, security, automation, and CI/CD best practices.

## Project Highlights:

- Implemented IAM permissions following the Principle of Least Privilege.

- Built a serverless API with AWS Lambda (Python) to track page views in DynamoDB.

- Hosted a static website on an AWS S3 bucket with CloudFront CDN and HTTPS.

- Configured Route 53 DNS for domain and subdomain resolution.

- Exposed the Lambda function via API Gateway with a RESTful POST endpoint.

- Integrated JavaScript to asynchronously update and display the visitor count.

- Automated deployments with GitHub Actions CI/CD, syncing the S3 bucket on every commit.

- Defined the entire cloud infrastructure using Terraform for reproducibility and scalability.

#### I enjoy building well-architected cloud solutions and would love to bring this expertise to your team!
