# Terraform Managed, AWS Hosted Resume

![System Design](/AWS.drawio.png)

While I'm #OpenToWork, I like to stay sharp with both established and new technologies. Recently, I deployed my resume as a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, and Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This project reinforced my expertise in AWS cloud architecture, security, automation, and CI/CD best practices.

## Project Highlights:

âœ… Implemented IAM best practices with fine-grained permissions following the Principle of Least Privilege.

âœ… Built a serverless API with AWS Lambda (Python) to track page views in DynamoDB.

âœ… Hosted a static website on an AWS S3 bucket with CloudFront CDN and HTTPS.

âœ… Configured Route 53 DNS for domain and subdomain resolution.

âœ… Exposed the Lambda function via API Gateway with a RESTful POST endpoint.

âœ… Integrated JavaScript to asynchronously update and display the visitor count.

âœ… Automated deployments with GitHub Actions CI/CD, syncing the S3 bucket on every commit.

âœ… Defined the entire cloud infrastructure using Terraform for reproducibility and scalability.

#### I enjoy building well-architected cloud solutions and would love to bring this expertise to your team!
