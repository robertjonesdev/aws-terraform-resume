              As a security-cleared Software Engineer, I designed and built
              mission-critical backend systems, data pipelines, and
              microservices involving classified and sensitive information,
              focusing on modernization and scalability.
            </div>
            <ul class="accomplishments">
              <li>
                Developed and enhanced a Java Spring Boot microservice that
                processes ATO/ACO data from user-uploaded USMTF text files. The
                service extracted security markings, organized data into Data
                Transfer Objects (DTOs), and stored them in a database for
                display in a user interface. This automation reduced manual
                effort by 5 hours per week.
              </li>
              <li>
                Project STORMBREAKER: Engineered high-performance
                Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipelines leveraging Python
                microservices with RabbitMQ message brokers and Redis caching,
                enabling machine-learning-assisted fusion of varied classified
                data sources for use in an AI-driven decision-making platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                Project GaRII (GenAI Planning Tool): Became the Python RabbitMQ
                messaging expert and fixed connectivity/durability issues in
                Python microservices. Replaced the Pika library with Celery‚Äôs
                Kombu to enable stable multi-threaded processing of multiple
                queues, eliminating data loss and improving system reliability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved testing processes by promoting test-driven development
                (TDD), increasing test coverage by 30% and cutting testing time
                by 86%, while mentoring a junior engineer on testing best
                practices.
